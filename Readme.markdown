### OpenPhoto plugin for WordPress

#### Installation

To install this plugin just drag the openphoto-wordphp folder and the file openphoto-wordpress.php into your `wp-content/plugins` directory.

#### Connecting WordPress to OpenPhoto

You'll need to go to *Settings->OpenPhoto* and enter the name of your OpenPhoto url. This is something like *http://current.openphoto.me*.

Clicking *Save Changes* will take you to your OpenPhoto site. You'll need to login, create an app and grant your blog access to it. Once complete you'll be redirected back to your WordPress site.

#### Adding photos into your blog posts

Click the media icon like you normally would and then select the *OpenPhoto* tab. Here you'll be able to filter by tags and select the photo to embed into your post.
